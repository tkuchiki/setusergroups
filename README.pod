=head1 NAME

setusergroups - set uid/pid/supplementary groups

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ setusergroups account child

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<account> is a single argument. I<child> consists of one or more arguments.

I<setusergroups> sets its uid and gid to account's uid and gid, removing all supplementary groups. It then runs I<child>.

I<setusergroups> exits 111 if it cannot find a UNIX account named I<account>, if it cannot setgid, if it cannot setuid, if it cannot initgroups, or if it cannot run child. Otherwise its exit code is the same as that of child.

I<setusergroups> cannot be run by anyone other than root.

=head1 setuidgid vs setusergroups

setusergroups support for supplementary groups.
